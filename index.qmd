### Welcome to the Turing PPL Community Page! 


<p>

</p>

The purpose of this community is to accelerate use of probabilistic programming languages in research & policy to drive understanding and innovation. Our core areas of focus are Health, Climate & Environment, and Spatial analyses, which align with the [Grand Challenges of the Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research). 

Within this website, you will find pages relating to all of our events, [forecasting competitions](pages/Forecasting_Competitions/index.qmd), workshops and [training materials](pages/Resources.qmd).
