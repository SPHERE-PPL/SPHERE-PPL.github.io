    "text": "Dr Will Pearse\nDr Will Pearse is a Reader in Evolutionary Ecology at Imperial College London. His lab develops new statistical and computational methods to better understand how species’ evolutionary history to better understand and predict their present-day ecology. He has worked with AI methods for most of his career, developing automated DNA analysis pipelines, birdsong detectors, and various automated image and video analysis tools. His lab use Probabilistic Programming Languages to solve a variety of statistical modelling problems, notably forecasting COVID-19 dynamics. His research work at the Turing focuses on building a solid research community based around probabilistic programming language by making conceptual advances in climate changes, human health, spatial modelling, forecasting contests to support decision-makers and developing training resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Juliette Uniwn\nDr Juliette Unwin is a Lecturer in Statistical Science in the School of Mathematics at the University of Bristol alongside being an Academic Visitor in the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Imperial College, London. She is an active member of MLGH, the Machine Learning and Global Health Network. She holds a Masters in Engineering from the University of Southampton and a PhD in Engineering from the University of Cambridge. Dr Unwin’s research revolves around developing and applying novel methods for infectious disease outbreak analysis to help inform policy makers in real time. Currently, she focuses on developing spatial temporal renewal based transmission models alongside estimating the number of children affected by COVID-19 and crises. Her research at the Turing focuses on advancing the adoption of Probabilistic Programming languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Seth Flaxman\nDr Seth Flaxman is an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford and a tutorial fellow of Jesus College.

Most people fully recover, but some get very sick. \nMpox is caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV). It is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus of the Orthopoxvirus genus in the Poxviridae family, which includes variola, cowpox, vaccinia and other viruses. There are two distinct clades of the virus: clade I (with subclades Ia and Ib) and clade II (with subclades IIa and IIb).\nA global outbreak of clade IIb began in 2022 and continues to this day, including in some African countries. There are also growing outbreaks of clades Ia and Ib affecting the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other countries in Africa. As of August 2024, clade Ib has also been detected beyond Africa.\nThe natural reservoir of the virus is unknown, but various small mammals such as squirrels and monkeys are susceptible.\nThe dataset included in this forecasting competition covers the period from Jan 2022 to July 2024.\nThis competition has its own repository with pre-prepared data (found in the data folder) and a template report (demo_analysis.qmd) which showcases how to load the data, perform analyses and then export results into the correct format. There is also be a folder for any additional scripts that are required.",
