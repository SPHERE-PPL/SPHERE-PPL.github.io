## **Wednesday 14th January 2026** \| **The Alan Turing Institute**

### Information

Join us for the second SPHERE-PPL Annual Meeting, a full-day gathering dedicated to advancing environmental modelling and forecasting. This event will bring together experts from industry, academia, and government to discuss cutting-edge research and explore collaborative opportunities within environmental science. 


Participants will have the opportunity to:

-   Network with policy specialists and data scientists to discuss issues through a common language
-   Identify forecasting contests that the SPHERE-PPL Community will undertake, and contribute to the design and outcomes of these endeavours to maximise their impact
-   Prioritise the training and support provided by SPHERE-PPL to the community to expedite the development of analytical capabilities where they are most urgently required


Keynote speakers will be announced closer to the time.

This event—and the forecasting contests that follow—are funded by The Alan Turing Institute.

### Registration {#sec-reg}

To register for this event please [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/iy6jC3Xg3QrTjBM67) with your details and why you would like to attend.

Attendance is free but participation is limited to 50 in-person attendees, with an application required (there is no limit on the number of subsequent forecasting contest participants). We will email successful applicants in early December. Attendance is not limited by sector, discipline, background, or career stage. If you use data to ask questions about the environment or agriculture this meeting is for you!

After this event, we will organise a series of follow-up on-line events to kick-off the forecasting contests and provide training in forecasting. More details will be shared at the meeting and afterwards on-line: if you can't make the meeting, [join the mailing list](https://sphere-ppl.org/pages/get_involved.html) to join in!
