# *A UK Spatial, Climate, & Health Probabilistic Programming Language Community*

![](images/scope.jpg){fig-align="center" width="500"}

For the UK to achieve global leadership in Probabilistic Programming Languages (PPL), it is necessary to cultivate a self-sustaining research community. Working with the Alan Turing Institute (ATI), the project team will help realise this vision by supporting:

1.  *Conceptual advances in focal research areas of strategic importance to the UK (climate, health, and spatial modelling)*

2.  *Forecasting contests to build a community based around addressing policy needs*

3.  *In-person and online training sessions*

This work, in conjunction with researchers and students at Imperial College London, University of Oxford and University of Bristol, will create a legacy of PPL leadership at ATI as part of its investment in [Fundamental Research](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/fundamental-ai).

A key part of building this community is to help connect organisations (e.g. charities, NGOs, Government departments) with analytical and research capabilities to help inform policy and develop knowledge. If you have an area of interest that would benefit from connecting with this network, please send us an email using the link on the homepage.
