# Overview

A core part of the SPHERE-PPL project is to run novel and engaging forecasting contests in the areas of Health, Environment and Spatial analyses. In each of the three years of the programme, alongside key stakeholders in the fields, we will be creating and running 3 contests. The table below has the current and past contests, which are all hosted on GitHub with specific details around what is being forecast and how to take part. Entries can be from teams or individuals from anywhere in the world. We strongly encourage collaboration and submissions from student teams using any methodologies that fall under the "Probabilistic Programming Language" banner.
